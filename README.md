CPS342-Project
==============

Project for CPS342 @ SUNY New Paltz (Embedded Linux).

In this project, I am using a Raspberry Pi to create a webserver. I have a motion sensor that will push data to
the webserver by using MySQL, PHP, and Python scripts. Included is documentation that follows the processes
that I have been following for each step along the way.
